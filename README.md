1.25mm to 1mm Floppy FFC Adapter

## Background:

This is a floppy drive adapter that I had constructed to adapt older 1.25mm 26 pin FFC floppy drive connectors to newer servo-driven 1.00mm 26 pin FFC floppy drives.

Older floppy drives and connectors in laptops and other embedded equipment in the 90s used 1.25mm 26 pin FFC connectors.  Such 90s laptops as the Tandy 1100FD as well as many older Toshiba 486 laptops (and even some early Pentium 1's) used 1.25mm FFC cables and floppy drives.  The 1.25mm floppy drives were all belt driven, and the difficulty of finding belts and replacing them dictates that many people refurbishing older equipment would benefit from just swapping out the drive for a 1.00mm servo-driven floppy drive (i.e. one that doesn't need a belt).

So, I made this adapter to allow people to use a 1.25mm laptop with a 1.00mm floppy drive.

## PCB Printing & BOM:  

### PCB Printing
OSH Park, Seeedstudio, PCBWay, etc, can print the PCBs for you.  Out of all of these, PCBWay is the only referral link. I have this project on their community page as well, and it points back to this repo. 
* [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/26_pin_1_25mm_to_1_00mm_Floppy_FFC_ribbon_adapter_88a0727c.html) can make these turnkey for you.  You can have a batch of 10 boards alone made for $5 or have them fully assembled and shipped to you for an extra fee.  
* [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/) is very inexpensive for users in the USA to get three boards made quickly.  
* [SeeedStudio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion.html) allows you to get 10 boards for US $4.90 plus shipping.

### BOM
You only need to solder two connectors:
1) 1.25mm FFC connector (through hole): Mouser part #[538-39-53-2264](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Molex/39-53-2264?qs=cm0cgiBciNapCElJrof18A%3D%3D)
2) 1.00mm FFC connector (SMT):  Mouser part #[538-52271-2679](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Molex/52271-2679?qs=nP5hwMgPNFSh44M207Ls0w%3D%3D)
3) Any 1.25mm or 1.00mm FFC cables that you need, in whatever length (this is up to you)
